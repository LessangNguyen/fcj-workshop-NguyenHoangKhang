# AWS HEALTHIMAGING: HOW TO STORE AND RETRIEVE MILLIONS OF MEDICAL IMAGES IN THE CLOUD

Imagine a hospital receiving thousands of medical images every day from X-ray, CT, MRI, and ultrasound equipment.

These images must be stored for long periods, retrieved quickly, and shared across different healthcare systems.

If all this data is stored entirely on on-premises infrastructure, hospitals may face several challenges:

- High infrastructure investment and maintenance costs.
- Limited scalability as medical imaging data continues to grow.
- Image retrieval delays that may affect the user experience.
- Difficulties integrating medical imaging data with AI/ML applications.

To address these challenges, AWS provides a specialized cloud service called **AWS HealthImaging**.

## 1. WHAT IS AWS HEALTHIMAGING?

AWS HealthImaging is a cloud-based service designed to help healthcare providers, life science organizations, and software partners store, analyze, and share medical images at petabyte scale.

The service supports medical imaging modalities such as:

- X-ray.
- CT Scan.
- MRI.
- Ultrasound.

One important aspect of AWS HealthImaging is its support for the **DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine)** standard, which is widely used for storing, transmitting, and exchanging medical imaging information.

Instead of requiring each hospital to build and maintain its own imaging storage infrastructure, HealthImaging provides a scalable cloud platform with low-latency image retrieval capabilities.

AWS HealthImaging focuses on three major use cases:

**1. Enterprise Imaging**

Stores and streams medical imaging data directly from AWS Cloud while supporting healthcare applications that require high availability and low-latency access.

**2. Long-term Image Archival**

Provides long-term medical image storage while maintaining fast retrieval capabilities, including subsecond retrieval access for supported workflows.

**3. AI/ML Development**

Enables developers and healthcare organizations to build AI/ML applications that process and perform inference on large medical imaging archives using additional AWS tools and services.

## 2. HOW DOES AWS HEALTHIMAGING PROCESS MEDICAL IMAGES?

This is one of the most interesting technical aspects of the service.

AWS HealthImaging is not simply a place to store image files. It also organizes and optimizes medical imaging data so that applications can retrieve and process it efficiently.

### A. DICOM Metadata – Managing Medical Image Information

Under the DICOM standard, medical images contain more than just pixel data. They also include metadata describing patients, imaging studies, and image series.

AWS HealthImaging automatically organizes imported DICOM data according to three major DICOM levels:

- **Patient:** Information associated with the patient.
- **Study:** A medical imaging examination or study.
- **Series:** A group of related images belonging to the same study.

HealthImaging transforms imported DICOM P10 files into AWS-managed Image Sets containing metadata and image frames.

After importing, the service normalizes DICOM metadata and makes individual attributes accessible through developer-friendly names rather than requiring developers to work directly with complex hexadecimal group and element identifiers.

This significantly reduces the complexity of building medical imaging applications.

### B. SIMD-Accelerated Image Decoding – Faster Image Processing

One major challenge when working with medical imaging data is its large size.

AWS HealthImaging uses **High Throughput JPEG 2000 (HTJ2K)**, an advanced image compression format designed to improve image encoding and decoding performance.

HTJ2K takes advantage of **SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data)**, a CPU optimization technique that allows a processor to perform the same operation on multiple data elements simultaneously.

This improves the speed of image decoding.

According to AWS documentation, HTJ2K decoding can be an order of magnitude faster than traditional JPEG 2000.

This is particularly useful when medical imaging applications need to load and display large volumes of image data efficiently.

**Important:** HTJ2K is the default lossless storage format for newly created HealthImaging data stores unless another supported format is selected.

### C. Progressive Resolution – Retrieving Images at Different Resolutions

Another important capability is progressive resolution access.

Instead of retrieving the entire high-resolution image immediately, applications can access image data at different resolution levels.

For example:

- When opening a medical imaging study, an application can retrieve lower-resolution image data first.
- When a user zooms into a specific region, the application can retrieve more detailed image data.
- Mobile devices can use lower-resolution image representations to improve loading performance.

This approach improves image loading and viewing experiences while preserving the original image quality through lossless image processing.

### D. Pixel Data Verification – Ensuring Data Integrity

Medical imaging data must maintain its integrity throughout the import and transformation process.

AWS HealthImaging provides built-in pixel data verification during image imports.

The service checks the lossless encoding and decoding state of imported images to ensure that images decoded from the stored representation match the original DICOM P10 image data.

AWS also generates Image Frame Resolution Checksums (IFRC) using the CRC32 algorithm to support verification.

This helps detect unintended changes to pixel data during image processing.

## 3. WHICH AWS SERVICES CAN WORK WITH HEALTHIMAGING?

An important lesson when learning AWS is that individual cloud services should not always be viewed independently.

AWS HealthImaging can integrate with multiple AWS services to build a complete medical imaging architecture.

Some important services include:

- **Amazon S3:** Acts as a staging area for storing source DICOM files before importing them into HealthImaging.
- **AWS IAM:** Manages identities, authentication, and access permissions.
- **Amazon CloudWatch:** Monitors HealthImaging resources and operational metrics.
- **AWS CloudTrail:** Records user activities and API calls for auditing.
- **AWS CloudFormation:** Automates infrastructure deployment through Infrastructure as Code (IaC).
- **Amazon EventBridge:** Enables event-driven architectures by routing HealthImaging events to other AWS services.
- **AWS PrivateLink:** Establishes private connectivity between applications in a VPC and HealthImaging without exposing traffic to the public internet.

**Example: A simplified medical imaging workflow**

1. The hospital uploads DICOM files to an Amazon S3 bucket.
2. An import job transfers the imaging data from S3 into an AWS HealthImaging data store.
3. HealthImaging organizes the imported data into Image Sets and manages associated metadata and image frames.
4. Healthcare applications use APIs to retrieve metadata and image data.
5. Amazon EventBridge can receive HealthImaging events and trigger additional processing workflows.

This architecture demonstrates how AWS services work together to build scalable cloud-based medical imaging systems.

## 4. HOW CAN AWS HEALTHIMAGING SUPPORT AI/ML DEVELOPMENT?

This is particularly interesting for people pursuing an AI Engineer career.

Imagine a hospital that owns millions of X-ray or CT images.

Instead of downloading the entire imaging archive to local infrastructure before processing it, AI/ML applications can access medical imaging data stored in AWS HealthImaging.

Potential use cases include:

**1. X-ray Image Analysis**

Developing machine learning models to analyze X-ray images and identify potential abnormalities.

**2. CT Scan Analysis**

Researching AI models that can assist in detecting suspicious regions or patterns in CT images.

**3. Precision Medicine**

Combining medical imaging data with clinical information and other healthcare datasets to support research in precision medicine.

AWS HealthImaging provides the imaging data foundation. Building and deploying AI/ML models requires additional frameworks, infrastructure, and services.

For example, developers may combine HealthImaging with Amazon SageMaker or other machine learning tools to build and deploy models.

**An important distinction:** AWS HealthImaging is not an automated disease diagnosis service.

AI-generated results used in clinical workflows must be reviewed by qualified healthcare professionals. Medical decisions should remain under appropriate human supervision.

## 5. IS MEDICAL DATA SECURE ON AWS HEALTHIMAGING?

Medical images often contain personal information and sensitive healthcare data.

Therefore, security is one of the most important considerations when designing a medical imaging system.

AWS HealthImaging is a **HIPAA-eligible service**, meaning it can be used as part of a solution designed to meet applicable HIPAA requirements.

Some important security capabilities include:

- **HTTPS/TLS:** Protects data during transmission.
- **Encryption at Rest:** Encrypts stored data using AWS encryption mechanisms and AWS KMS.
- **AWS IAM:** Controls access through identity-based and resource-based permissions.
- **AWS CloudTrail:** Records API activity and user operations for auditing.
- **AWS PrivateLink:** Supports private network connectivity to the service.

However, an important point must be understood:

**HIPAA eligibility does not automatically mean that an entire application or hospital system is HIPAA compliant.**

Organizations remain responsible for implementing appropriate security controls, access policies, operational procedures, and compliance requirements.

## 6. KEY TAKEAWAYS

AWS HealthImaging is much more than a cloud storage service for medical images.

Its major strengths include:

- Managing medical imaging data based on the DICOM standard.
- Optimizing image retrieval and decoding performance.
- Supporting scalable storage at petabyte scale.
- Integrating with the AWS ecosystem for AI/ML development.
- Supporting secure and scalable medical imaging architectures.

One important lesson when learning Cloud Computing and pursuing an AI Engineer career:

Building a successful AI system requires more than just a good Machine Learning model.

You also need a strong data architecture capable of storing, managing, retrieving, and processing large volumes of data efficiently.

AWS HealthImaging is a practical example of how cloud infrastructure can help solve large-scale data challenges in healthcare AI.

**My takeaway:** Before developing an AI model, we should understand where its data comes from, how that data is stored, and how efficiently it can be accessed. In real-world AI engineering, data infrastructure is just as important as model development.
